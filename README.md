# Odin Landing Page Project

This repository is attempted at creating a landing page for the Odin Project's foundation course. The landing page utilizes flex to display elements on the page. 

This website was created entirely with HTML and CSS, with no other frameworks or plugins. The main goal of the project is to demonstrate my understanding of flexbox, and there may be features missing that are not covered in the current course.
